# VolleyJDeferred

This is a basic sample application that combines Android's HTTP Library Volley with a Java Deferred/Promise library by the name of JDeferred.  Other libraries used include ButterKnife for view injection and Gson for JSON object consumption. Links can be found below.  Again, this is meant to serve as a basic foundation for asynchronous programming using Volley, though future branches may include additional features.
